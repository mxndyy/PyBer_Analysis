# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview 
The purpose of this project is to create visualizations of rideshare data by performing analysis of Pyber ride sharing data to examine ridership and fare metrics by the types of cities in which Pyber operates and use the summary of this data to influence future business decisions.

## Results
### Differences in ride-sharing data among different city types

- Results show that Urban areas have highest number of rides but average fare per ride and per driver are lower than rural area. 
- Total fares in Urban cities are higher than both the suburban and rural cities ($39,854.38.
- The lowest averagefare per driver is present in Urban cities ($16.57)

## Summary
### Recommendations 
- Rural cities rides are more expensive due to scarcity, finding ways to optimize pricing to allow for lower cost rides to these areas may allow other cities to increase profitability.
- Urban cities account for the most total fares, most rides, and most drivers. I would recommend lowering the total number of drivers and providing incentives for drivers to take on rides in rural areas. 
- The line chart shows lower fares in rural areas in January, it would be my recommendation to obtain additional data regarding the affects of weather in these rural areas during seasons that have adverse affects on travel by car such as winter.
